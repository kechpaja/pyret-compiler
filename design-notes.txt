This will be a file of design notes. We can use it collaborate asynchronously. 


Since LLVM is based on SSA, we can't just assign to an existing variable.
Thus, we will need to add a subscript to every variable, so that we have
things like x1, x2, x3, etc. This is something to think about a bit more.

We'll probably also need to pass an environment of some sort, to handle
closures. However, this may not be necessary right now.
