Things to do for compiler: 

ANF Passes:
    - Filter lets
    - Lift data type declarations to top
    - Lift numbers, strings, booleans
    - Lift/rewrite functions, rewrite function calls
        - All functions are declared at top
        - Detect free variables
        - Add argument to function call that takes record

ANF->Intermediate:
    - Introduce/instantiate closures
    - Rewrite cases to select appropriate parts of object memory/do binding
    - Rewrite data type constructors to be lower level
    - Add/create vtable information

Intermediate Passes:
    - Rewrite tests in pattern matching

- We need to finish flushing out LLVM representation
